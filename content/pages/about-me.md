# Hello and Welcome!

My name is Plovski, and this website marks the beginning of my journey into the world of static site generators, specifically **Hugo**. I created this site to learn, experiment, and share my thoughts on technology, development, and personal projects.

## The Power of Static Sites

This site is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and managed through **GitHub Actions** and **Cloudflare**. It‚Äôs an exercise in efficiency and control. No complex databases, just fast, secure, and easily version-controlled content.

### What to Expect on this Site:

* **Development Notes:** My learning log on Go, Git, and web technologies.
* **Project Showcase:** Small projects I'm currently tinkering with.
* **Thoughts on Tech:** Personal opinions on the latest industry trends.

## üñºÔ∏è Picture Placeholder

To make the site engaging, I plan to include visual elements. You can add an image right here!

![A placeholder image showing a desk setup or a simple logo.](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/0000FF/FFFFFF?text=Plovski+Web+Dev)

**How to replace this image:**

1.  Place your image file (e.g., `me.jpg`) in the **`static/images/`** folder inside your Hugo project.
2.  Replace the placeholder URL above with your file path: `![A picture of me](/images/me.jpg)`
