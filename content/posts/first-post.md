# Introduction: The Shift from Dynamic to Static

The modern web development landscape is undergoing a quiet revolution. Where monolithic, dynamic content management systems (CMS) once dominated, the focus is now shifting towards performance, security, and simplicity offered by static site generators (SSGs) like **Hugo**. This post explores the technical and philosophical reasons behind this trend, particularly within academic and technical publishing circles.

## 1. Performance and Security

A static site is, fundamentally, a collection of pre-rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Since there is no database or server-side processing layer, the attack surface is drastically reduced. The site is inherently faster because the server simply delivers files, eliminating the need for complex database queries on every page load.

> *"Performance is not just a feature; it is the foundation of the user experience."* - **A core principle for modern web publishing.**

## 2. The Academic Appeal of Markdown

For academics and technical writers, content structure and longevity are paramount. Hugo's reliance on **Markdown** (`.md`) files offers several advantages:

* **Portability:** Content is plain text, easily backed up and migrated.
* **Version Control:** Entire content history can be tracked perfectly using Git (as we have done for this site!).
* **Focus:** Writers focus on structure and text, not complex WYSIWYG editors.

## 3. Deployment Simplicity

The combination of Hugo and platforms like **GitHub Actions** creates a "Write and Push" workflow. As soon as a change is committed to the main branch, the entire site is rebuilt and redeployed automatically, dramatically simplifying the maintenance pipeline. This is the exact system running on `plovski.dk`.

## Conclusion

The static site renaissance is driven by a focus on core web values: speed, security, and simplicity. As a tool built with Go, Hugo stands out as an incredibly fast and powerful choice for anyone—from hobbyists to large organizations—seeking a modern, efficient publishing platform.

## Trin 3: Opdater Menuen (valgfrit)

Hvis du vil have et menupunkt, der viser **alle dine blogindlæg**, skal du tilføje en *Listesektion* til din `hugo.toml`:

Åbn **`hugo.toml`** og sørg for, at din `[[menu.main]]` sektion indeholder dette (hvis ikke, så tilføj det):

```toml
[[menu.main]]
    identifier = "blog"
    name = "Blog"
    url = "/posts/" # Viser listen over alle indlæg i /content/posts/
    weight = 30
